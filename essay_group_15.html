<h1 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
<p>As societies across Europe continue to <strong>age</strong>,
understanding how causes of death change over time has become
increasingly important. Such information supports public health policy,
healthcare planning, and discussions about the challenges of an aging
population. However, data alone is not enough—the way information is
<strong>visualized</strong> strongly influences how trends are
understood and interpreted.</p>
<p>Statistical agencies such as <strong>Eurostat</strong> provide
reliable data with accompanying visualizations, but even accurate charts
can be ineffective if they create unnecessary cognitive burden. Poor
design may cause key patterns to be misinterpreted or overlooked.</p>
<p>This article examines a <strong>Eurostat chart</strong> showing
changes in causes of death among women aged <strong>65 and over in the
EU (2012–2022)</strong>. By identifying the limitations of the original
static visualization, we demonstrate how design choices affect
comprehension and present an <strong>interactive redesign</strong> that
improves clarity and accessibility while preserving data integrity.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="context-and-visualization-selection">2. Context and
Visualization Selection</h1>
<p>The visualization analyzed in this article originates from
<strong>Eurostat</strong>, the statistical office of the European Union,
and presents data on <strong>causes of death among women aged 65 years
or over</strong> between <strong>2012 and 2022</strong>. The data are
expressed as an <strong>index based on the standardized death rate per
100,000 inhabitants</strong>, with the year <strong>2012 set to a
baseline value of 100</strong>. This normalization allows readers to
focus on <strong>relative changes over time</strong> rather than
absolute mortality levels.</p>
<p>The topic of this visualization is <strong>socially and politically
significant</strong>. As life expectancy increases across the European
Union, the health conditions affecting older populations become a
central concern for <strong>policymakers, healthcare systems, and the
public</strong>. Understanding which causes of death are becoming more
or less prevalent over time can inform <strong>resource allocation,
preventive strategies, and long-term healthcare planning</strong>,
making clear visualization of such trends essential for public
understanding.</p>
<p>This particular visualization was selected because it represents a
<strong>common scenario in public data communication</strong>: an
authoritative dataset paired with a <strong>conventional but densely
packed static line chart</strong>. At first glance, the chart appears
comprehensive and informative. However, closer inspection reveals
<strong>design choices that make trends difficult to interpret</strong>,
especially for <strong>non-expert readers</strong>. The complexity of
the visual encoding and the lack of direct access to exact values
<strong>limit the chart’s effectiveness</strong>.</p>
<p>By choosing this example, the article aims to illustrate how even
<strong>credible official visualizations</strong> can benefit from
<strong>redesign</strong>. The goal is not to criticize the data source,
but to demonstrate how <strong>thoughtful visualization design</strong>
can enhance understanding and make important <strong>public health
stories more accessible</strong> to a broader audience.</p>

</figure>
<p>The original visualization is a <strong>static multi-line
chart</strong> published by <strong>Eurostat</strong>, titled
<em>“Causes of death among women aged 65 years or over, EU,
2012–22.”</em> It displays <strong>indexed trends for multiple causes of
death</strong> across a <strong>ten-year period</strong>, with the
horizontal axis representing <strong>time</strong> and the vertical axis
showing an <strong>index based on the standardized death rate</strong>,
where <strong>2012 is set to 100</strong>, allowing readers to focus on
<strong>relative changes over time</strong>.</p>
<p>Each cause of death is represented by a <strong>distinct colored
line</strong> with <strong>point markers</strong> indicating yearly
observations. A <strong>legend listing all categories</strong> is
positioned on the <strong>right-hand side</strong> of the chart. The
visualization is designed to show how <strong>mortality patterns among
older women in the EU</strong> have changed over time and to
<strong>compare trends across causes of death</strong> within a
<strong>single consolidated view</strong>.</p>
<p>By presenting all categories within <strong>one figure</strong>, the
chart aims to provide a <strong>comprehensive overview</strong> of
long-term developments in mortality. Readers are expected to
<strong>follow individual lines over time</strong> and use the
<strong>legend</strong> to associate each line with its cause of death,
thereby understanding <strong>how multiple trends coexist within the
same time frame</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="analysis-of-the-original-visualization">4. Analysis of the
Original Visualization</h1>
<p>At first glance, the original Eurostat visualization appears
<strong>comprehensive and authoritative</strong>, presenting a large
amount of information within a single figure. By indexing the
standardized death rate to a <strong>common baseline year</strong>, the
chart allows readers to focus on <strong>relative changes over
time</strong> rather than absolute values. The use of <strong>line
position on a shared vertical scale</strong> is an effective visual
encoding and enables <strong>high-level comparison of trends</strong>
across different causes of death.</p>
<p>Despite these strengths, several <strong>design choices make the
underlying story difficult to follow</strong>. The chart relies on a
<strong>detached legend</strong> placed on the right-hand side, listing
all causes of death in an order that does not clearly correspond to the
visual ordering of the lines. As a result, readers must repeatedly shift
their attention between the legend and the chart, creating a
<strong>split-attention effect</strong> and increasing <strong>cognitive
load</strong>, especially given the number of lines displayed.</p>
<p>In addition, the visualization is <strong>entirely static</strong>,
which limits access to <strong>precise information</strong>. Individual
data points are marked but not labeled, and readers cannot retrieve
<strong>exact values</strong> for specific years without visual
estimation. While this supports recognition of general trends, it makes
<strong>detailed comparison</strong> difficult, particularly for
<strong>non-expert audiences</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>density of information</strong> further contributes to
the challenge. Multiple lines with <strong>similar colors and
overlapping trajectories</strong> compete for attention, requiring
sustained effort to track individual causes of death. Although the chart
maintains a relatively high <strong>data-ink ratio</strong>, the lack of
<strong>direct labeling and interaction</strong> places additional
demands on the reader’s <strong>working memory</strong>, hindering
efficient comprehension.</p>
<p>Overall, the original visualization provides a <strong>broad overview
of mortality trends</strong> among older women in the European Union,
but its <strong>static design</strong> and reliance on a
<strong>detached legend</strong> limit effective storytelling. The
information is present, yet the <strong>effort required to extract
insights</strong> may reduce reader engagement and weaken the
visualization’s ability to <strong>communicate its message
clearly</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="replicating-the-original-visualization">5. Replicating the
Original Visualization</h1>
<figure>
<img src="replicated_chart.png"
alt="Figure 2: Replication of the original Eurostat visualization using the same data and layout." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 2: Replication of the original
Eurostat visualization using the same data and layout.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To verify our understanding of the original Eurostat chart, we first
replicated the static visualization using the same dataset and visual
encoding. The replication was implemented in Python with pandas for data
processing and matplotlib for plotting, applying the same index
transformation in which the year 2012 is set to 100, thereby preserving
the original visual and data structure.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="design-goals-and-proposed-improvements">6. Design Goals and
Proposed Improvements</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the original visualization, the primary goal
of the redesign was to make the <strong>underlying trends easier to
follow</strong> and the data more accessible to a general audience.
Rather than changing the dataset itself, the redesign focuses on
improving how the information is presented, emphasizing clarity over
visual complexity.</p>
<p>The first design goal was to <strong>reduce cognitive load</strong>
caused by the detached legend and dense visual layout. To achieve this,
the redesign replaces the traditional legend with <strong>direct
labeling</strong>, ensuring that each line is clearly associated with
its corresponding cause of death. By positioning labels directly
alongside the visual elements, the redesign minimizes the
split-attention effect and supports <strong>immediate visual
association</strong>.</p>
<p>A second goal was to improve temporal understanding. In the original
static chart, all trends are presented simultaneously, which can be
overwhelming. The redesigned visualization introduces
<strong>animation</strong> to guide attention along the time axis,
allowing trends to emerge gradually and reinforcing a clearer sense of
progression over time.</p>
<p>Finally, the redesign seeks to improve data accessibility and support
<strong>precise comparison</strong>. To address the limitation of
unlabeled data points, <strong>interactive features</strong> are
introduced that allow users to explore exact values on demand. This
balances overview and detail while preserving a clean visual
appearance.</p>
<p>Together, these design goals emphasize <strong>clarity, readability,
and accessibility</strong>. By combining <strong>direct labeling,
animation, and interactivity</strong>, the proposed improvements aim to
communicate the data story more effectively and enable a more intuitive
reading experience.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="implementation-interactive-redesign">7. Implementation:
Interactive Redesign</h1>
<p>The redesigned visualization transforms the original static chart
into a dynamic and interactive experience implemented as an
<strong>HTML-based visualization</strong>. When the page is loaded, all
lines begin at the initial year and gradually extend forward along the
time axis. This <strong>animated progression</strong> guides the
viewer’s attention chronologically and makes it easier to follow how
each cause of death evolves over time, supporting a more guided temporal
reading process.</p>
<p>To address the limitations of the <strong>detached legend</strong>,
each line is accompanied by a <strong>moving label</strong> that extends
together with the line. These labels display the <strong>cause of
death</strong> and the <strong>current index value</strong> at the end
point of the line. Once the animation is complete, the labels remain at
the end of their respective lines, creating a clear and direct
association between visual elements and their meanings and enabling
<strong>immediate identification</strong> of trends.</p>
<p><strong>Interactivity</strong> further enhances data accessibility.
As users move the mouse across the chart, a <strong>tooltip</strong>
appears showing the values of all causes of death at the selected year.
This enables <strong>precise comparison across categories</strong> while
preserving a clean visual layout, allowing users to move smoothly
between overview and detail.</p>
<p>Overall, the interactive redesign preserves data integrity while
improving <strong>clarity and usability</strong>. Through
<strong>animation, direct labeling, and on-demand interaction</strong>,
the visualization becomes a more engaging and intuitive representation,
making changes in mortality trends easier to understand through active
reader engagement.</p>

<h1 id="comparison-before-vs-after">8. Comparison: Before vs After</h1>
<p>Comparing the original Eurostat visualization with the
<strong>redesigned interactive version</strong> highlights how
<strong>design choices influence data understanding</strong>. Although
both visualizations rely on the same dataset, their effectiveness in
communicating trends differs substantially, demonstrating the impact of
presentation on comprehension.</p>
<p>In the original chart, all causes of death are shown simultaneously
in a static layout, with a <strong>detached legend</strong> positioned
to the side. Readers must repeatedly shift attention between the legend
and the lines to identify trends. In contrast, the redesigned
visualization uses <strong>direct labeling</strong>, allowing each line
to be <strong>immediately associated</strong> with its category and
<strong>reducing cognitive effort</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>representation of time</strong> also differs markedly.
The original visualization presents the entire time span at once, which
can be overwhelming and obscure year-to-year development. The redesigned
version introduces <strong>animation</strong> that gradually reveals
trends, guiding attention along the <strong>time axis</strong> and
supporting a clearer understanding of temporal change.</p>
<p><strong>Access to precise data</strong> is another key distinction.
In the static chart, values must be visually estimated, limiting
detailed comparison. The interactive redesign allows users to retrieve
<strong>exact values on demand</strong>, supporting both
<strong>overview and detailed analysis</strong> without adding visual
clutter.</p>
<p>Overall, this comparison shows that the redesign does not change the
data itself, but improves how easily the message can be understood. By
reducing <strong>split attention</strong>, guiding visual focus, and
enabling <strong>interaction</strong>, the redesigned visualization
communicates the same story more <strong>clearly and
effectively</strong>, resulting in a more transparent and interpretable
data narrative.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="reflection-and-conclusion">9. Reflection and Conclusion</h1>
<p>This case study demonstrates that effective data visualization is not
solely about presenting accurate data, but about <strong>enabling
understanding</strong>. The original Eurostat chart was based on
reliable and meaningful data, yet its <strong>static design</strong> and
reliance on a detached legend made the underlying trends difficult to
follow. Through analysis and redesign, it became clear that small design
decisions can have a substantial impact on how a data story is
perceived.</p>
<p>The redesign process highlights the importance of revision in
information visualization. By focusing on <strong>reducing cognitive
load</strong>, <strong>avoiding split attention</strong>, and guiding
reader focus through animation and interactivity, the improved
visualization makes the same data more accessible without altering its
content. These changes show how visualization design can bridge the gap
between complex datasets and non-expert audiences.</p>
<p>More broadly, this exercise underscores the <strong>responsibility of
visualization designers</strong>, especially when working with public
health data. Visualizations shape how evidence is interpreted and can
influence public discourse and decision-making. Clear and thoughtful
design is therefore a critical component of responsible data
communication, not merely an aesthetic choice.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this article shows that a strong data story requires
both accurate data and careful design. By rethinking how information is
structured and presented, even well-established visualizations can
become clearer and more engaging narratives, reinforcing the value of
<strong>iterative design</strong> and the role of information
visualization in making <strong>societal data meaningful and
understandable</strong>.</p>
